 Employee Free Time (hard)
 For K employees, we're given a list of intervals representing the working hours of each employee.
 Find out if there is a free interval that is common to all employees. You can assume that each list 
 of employee working hours is sorted on the start time.
 
 Example 1: [[[1,3], [5,6]], [[2,3], [6,8]]];
 Output: [3,5] --> Both employees are free between [3,5].
 
 Example 2: [[[1,3], [9,12]], [[2,4], [6,8]]];
 Output: [4,6], [8,9]
 
 Example 3: [[[1,3], [2,4]], [[3,5], [7,9]]];
 Output: [5,7]
